        <h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
        <p>Defined as a "Psychological phenomenon
          where someone persistently feels inadequate,
          doubts their accomplishments, and fears
          being exposed as a <strong>fraud</strong> despite
          evidence of their competence."
        </p>
        <p>It seems as though many of us, at some point in our lives,
          will find ourselves in a face-face battle with our mind.
          Although one might be complacent initially, 
          it wont be until they meet the geniuses of the world, where they will
          realize; "they aren't prominent as they thought to be."
          Even if this is the case, one should cherish their
          goals and accomplishments. As at the end of the tunnel, there is light, 
          reward, and solitude. One must be happy with themselves and not fraught at the sight
          Of another individuals success or outcome. <strong>Be happy</strong>,
          the path forward may seem slow, but slow progress is better than no progress.

        <h3>The Power of Excuses</h3>
        <p>
          <Strong>Excuses</Strong>, defined as "a reason or explanation put forward to defend or justify a fault or offense"
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of power we as humans have, always seems to be limited  by <em>"mental capacity"</em>. 
          This limit sometimes stops us from making decisions we otherwise would have made in a different reality.
          I like to think of this "something" in the form of <strong>excuses</strong>. See the issue with formulated excuses
          are that they are easy to come by. Many wish to start a new chapter in their lives (go to college, start your fitness journey, get you drivers license) 
          and don't "they can do it or start tomorrow"

        <P>On the week of April 13th, the tech department worked on a project to upgrade our phone system.
          This project exposed me to issues surrounding <strong>VLAN</strong> (Virtual Local Area Network), <strong>DHCP</strong> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), 
          <strong>POE</strong> (Power over Ethernet), <strong>AP</strong> (Access Points), IP and Digital Phones and other various topics.
