        <h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
        <p>Defined as a "Psychological phenomenon
          where someone persistently feels inadequate,
          doubts their accomplishments, and fears
          being exposed as a <strong>fraud</strong> despite
          evidence of their competence."
        </p>
        <p>It seems as though many of us, at some point in our lives
          will find ourselves in a face-face battle with our mind.
          Although one might find themselves complacent initially, 
          it wont be until they meet the geniuses of the world where they will
          realize; "they aren't as they thought."
          Even if this might be the case, one should still be happy,
          goals are goals and at the end of the tunnel there is light, 
          reward, and solitude. One must be happy with themselves.
          You just bought your first car? <strong>be happy</strong>, do not dwell over its price or non-state-of-the-art features.
          The path forward may seem slow, but slow progress is better than no progress.

        <h3>The Power of Excuses</h3>
        <p>
          <Strong>Excuses</Strong>, defined as "a reason or explanation put forward to defend or justify a fault or offense"
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of power we as humans have, always seems to be limited  by <em>"mental capacity"</em>. 
          This limit sometimes stops us from making decisions we otherwise would have made in a different reality.
          I like to think of this "something" in the form of <strong>excuses</strong>. See the issue with formulated excuses
          are that they are easy to come by. Many wish to start a new chapter in their lives (go to college, start your fitness journey, get you drivers license) 
          and don't "they can do it or start tomorrow"
